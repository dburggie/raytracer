# raytracer

## Introduction

raytracer is a library for rendering 3D scenes of objects. It tries to be
faithful to the physics of light as far as reflections and refractions go,
and it tries to describe objects with mathematical purity (that is, a sphere
defined as a point and a radius, not a set of facets approximating a sphere).
